**1. What is the difference between private limited and public limited company? State one example for each type.**

The main difference is that Public Limited Company is listed in stock exchange(Examples of such platforms are IBKR for international, and Bursa for Malaysia), where the public is allowed to trade the shares. Meanwhile, Private Limited Company(known as Sdn. Bhd. in Malaysia, specific terms differ depends on country) is not listed in stock exchange. The shares are handled privately by certain members of the company itself. Public Limited Company are allowed to issue a prospectus(which specify the investment offering to the publics), while Private Limited Company are not allowed to publish a prospectus. Private Limited Company enjoy more perks as compared to Public Limited Company.

**8. You have RM 10,000 savings and want to purchase shares as an investment for earning side income. 
You have listed two potential companies and need to select one company to invest. 
Comparing _Pentamaster Corporation Bhd._ and _ViTrox Corporation Bhd._ Justify your investment choice.** <br/>

Both companies are known for automated equipment manufacturing. ViTrox manufactures inspection equipment and system-on-chip embedded electronic devices. As for Pentamaster, it has 3 different business segments, that includes the automated equipment segment, automated manufacturing segment and smart control segment. 

We shall analyse both company for the year of 2019.

In terms of liquidity, both companies have more than enough cash for all their short/long term debts. However, Pentamaster have a significantly higher cash ratio at 3.37 as compared to that of ViTrox(2.16). Cash ratio, AKA quick ratio measures the liquidity of the company in paying off short term debts by using only cash or its equivalents. Hence Pentamaster provides higher liquidity than ViTrox.

ViTrox had lower net profit margin(23.45%) as compared to that of Pentamaster(26.75%). However, when analysed in terms of return on equity, ViTrox edged out by a slight margin, with 16.51%, as opposed to Pentamaster with 13.94%. Return on equity is the net income of the company, divided by the shareholder's equity, which determine the efficiency of profit generation by the company. As each company holds a win for 2 different profitability metric, we award a tie in terms of profitability.

Pentamaster has significantly higher growth in terms of revenue and net profit. While past performance doesn't guarantee future profit(for what we know, the burst growth of Pentamaster may not be sustainable, while the slower growth of ViTrox may be more consistent), Pentamaster wins in terms of growth, despite both companies being part of the same industry that are facing the same competition. Pentamaster has significantly lower share price than ViTrox despite having much higher growth. While share price is not everything in evaluating a company, te fact that Pentamaster has lower share price is a win for Pentamaster(more accessable to the public). As growth companies, the divident yield of both companies are not very significant, hence they are not included in the comparison of both companies.

After the analysis, I will choose to invest in pentamaster, due to its superior statistics in growth, profits(net and ROE), along with its higher liquidity, which can translate to company stability to a certain degree.
